# Dijkstra's Algorithm for Point and Rigid Robot

## Dependencies

- Opencv
- Python3.5 (use queue)
- Python2.7 (use Queue)
- Numpy

## Instructions

To run the code for point robot, open the terminal in Codes folder and type
```
python3 Dijkstra_point.py
``` 

To run the code for rigid robot, open the terminal in Codes folder and type
```
python3 Dijkstra_rigid.py
```

## Time for execution

Keeping start point as (5, 5) and goal point as (195, 295)

- Algorithm time for point robot: 1.2 seconds and visualization time for point robot: 85 seconds

- Algorithm time for rigid robot: 1.2 seconds and visualization time for rigid robot: 74 seconds
